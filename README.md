# AI-Powered Podcast Generation with Text-to-Speech Models  

This repository explores and implements state-of-the-art Text-to-Speech (TTS) systems to automate podcast generation, addressing the growing demand for AI-generated content in the digital age. It includes a comprehensive framework for synthesizing high-quality, multi-speaker, multilingual, and long-form audio content, using advanced models like SpeechT5, Bark, and MMS-TTS.  

## **Overview**  
Podcast creation offers diverse niches and privacy advantages, but generating podcasts at scale remains challenging. This project explores innovative architectures such as WaveNets, MelGAN, and pre-trained TTS models to deliver natural-sounding, speaker-specific, and multi-language audio outputs.  

## **Key Features**  
- **SpeechT5**: Personalizes speech synthesis with speaker embeddings, producing high-fidelity speech for podcast use cases.  
- **Bark**: Excels in generating long-form conversational audio with multiple speaker presets and emotional tones.  
- **VITS (MMS-TTS)**: Multilingual support for text-to-speech synthesis, especially for languages like Hindi.  
- **GAN-based Approaches**: Implements concepts like MelGAN for conditional audio synthesis, leveraging mel-spectrograms and multiscale discriminator architectures.  
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Uses WER (Word Error Rate) for accuracy and PESQ (Perceptual Evaluation of Speech Quality) to measure audio fidelity and perceived quality.  

## **Results and Analysis**  
- **Best Model**: Among tested models, the Bark model demonstrated the best results for podcast generation. It supports multiple voice presets, incorporates varied speech patterns, and generates long-form audio while distinguishing between speakers effectively.  
- **Limitations**: While MMS-TTS supports more languages, Bark provides superior results for podcasting due to its multi-speaker and long-form audio capabilities.  
- **Future Work**: Bark can be enhanced to support additional languages, generate even longer podcasts, and optimize processing for parallelization to reduce runtime.  

## **Paper and Research**  
The accompanying paper provides a deeper analysis of the models, architectures, training strategies, and evaluation techniques. It also discusses innovations like leveraging conditional WaveNets and MelGAN architectures for podcast generation.  

### **Frameworks and Architectures Covered in the Paper**:  
1. **WaveNets**: Uses dilated causal convolutions for high-fidelity speech synthesis.  
2. **MelGAN**: Employs a fully convolutional generator and multiscale discriminators to generate audio from mel-spectrograms, using a hinge-loss GAN objective.  

### **Datasets and Metrics**  
- **Dataset**: LibriSpeech is used for training and evaluation.  
- **Metrics**: WER and PESQ assess accuracy and perceived quality, respectively.
